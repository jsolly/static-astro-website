## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [our guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |

## Biome Configuration Notes

The project includes specific linting overrides for `.svelte`, `.astro`, and `.vue` files in `biome.json`. These overrides (disabling `useConst` and `useImportType` rules) are necessary due to limited Astro support as of January 1, 2025. See (Biome language support)[https://biomejs.dev/internals/language-support/#html-super-languages-support] for more information.

## Husky Configuration Notes

A pre-commit hook has been configured in `.husky/pre-commit` that runs lint-staged before each commit. The script:
- Runs lint-staged to format and lint staged files using Biome
- Checks the exit status of lint-staged
- Fails the commit if lint-staged reports any errors
- Includes helpful error messages to guide developers when linting fails

```shell
pnpm lint-staged
lint_status=$?

if [ $lint_status -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Lint-staged failed! Please fix the errors and try committing again."
  exit $lint_status
fi

# Ensure the script exits with success if everything passed
exit 0
```

This ensures that all committed code meets the project's formatting and linting standards.
